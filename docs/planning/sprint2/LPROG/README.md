# Drone Programming Language Creation

This document serves to outline the purpose and scope of the work to be developed in the LAPR4 project regarding the creation of a programming language for drones, as required by the LPROG curricular unit.

A domain-specific programming language (DSL) will be designed to describe drone routines and figures in a neutral and extensible way. The language will be specified and implemented using ANTLR, allowing for the definition of its grammar and the automatic generation of parsers and other language processing tools.

At this stage, the document will focus on the motivation, objectives, and general approach for the language design and implementation. Details about how the language will interact with other components of the system, or how it will be integrated, will be addressed in future phases as the project evolves and more information becomes available.

The main goals are:
- To define a clear and robust syntax for the drone programming language.
- To ensure the language is flexible enough to describe different types of drone figures and movements.
- To provide a solid foundation for future extensions and integration with the rest of the project.

Further sections of this document will describe the requirements, design decisions, and technical options for the development of the drone programming language.
