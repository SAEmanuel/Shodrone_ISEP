# US251 - Specification of the Language for Figure and Show Description

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a PO, I want a high-level neutral language to describe figures to be specified.  
This language will have to support the requirements in section 3.1.3.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- The language is designed to be high-level and neutral to describe figures and shows.
- It must be precise enough to be parsed and validated by tools.
- The language grammar is defined in an ANTLR file named `Figures.g4`.
- The grammar supports figure and show description requirements outlined in section 3.1.3.
- Parsing is done through the lexer and parser generated by ANTLR.
- Input files are plain text, typically named `input.txt`, written using the defined language syntax.

**Clarifications:**

- **Q: What kinds of figure/show elements does the language support?**  
  A: Elements needed to describe figures as per 3.1.3 requirements, such as identifiers, attributes, categories, etc.

- **Q: How is syntax validation performed?**  
  A: Using ANTLR-generated lexer and parser classes compiled from `Figures.g4`.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1**: The language grammar is formalized and implemented in the `Figures.g4` ANTLR grammar file.
- **AC2**: The lexer and parser classes are automatically generated from `Figures.g4`.
- **AC3**: The system accepts input files (`input.txt`) describing figures/shows in the language and parses them without errors.
- **AC4**: Syntax errors must be caught with clear error messages pointing to line and character positions.
- **AC5**: The parsing process must produce an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for further semantic processing.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- **ANTLR toolchain**: Required to generate lexer and parser classes from `Figures.g4`.
- **Makefile**: Used to automate the build process of compiling the grammar and running tests.
- **Input Files**: Typically named `input.txt` containing figure/show descriptions in the defined language.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

- **File**:
  - `input.txt`

**Output Data:**

- Success or error confirmation
- Diagnostic messages if the grammar is invalid
- DSL metadata for verification and debugging
