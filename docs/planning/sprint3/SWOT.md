## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 SWOT: Origin and Applications

The SWOT analysis framework, developed in the 1960s by Albert Humphrey at the Stanford Research Institute, is a strategic planning tool designed to evaluate internal and external factors influencing an organization’s or team’s performance. Its simplicity and versatility have made it a cornerstone of strategic management across diverse contexts, from corporate enterprises to agile software development teams.

The SWOT matrix is structured around two primary dimensions:

| **Internal Factors**         | **External Factors**          |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Strengths**               | **Opportunities**            |
| **Weaknesses**              | **Threats**                  |

- **Internal Factors**: Encompass controllable elements such as technical expertise, team organization, and communication practices.
- **External Factors**: Include environmental influences beyond the team’s direct control, such as academic demands, requirement changes, or technological advancements.

Originally developed for corporate planning, SWOT has proven highly adaptable, finding applications in agile methodologies, educational settings, and innovation-driven frameworks such as Design Thinking and Lean Startup. Its strengths lie in its ability to foster collaborative reflection, support data-driven decision-making, and provide a clear framework for actionable outcomes.

### 2.2 SWOT in Agile Teams and Scrum

In the context of agile methodologies, particularly Scrum, SWOT analysis is instrumental in promoting **self-organization, continuous learning, and team resilience**. Unlike traditional evaluation methods, an agile-focused SWOT emphasizes:

- Mapping technical and collaborative capabilities (code review practices, continuous integration, team cohesion).
- Identifying subtle weaknesses that may emerge in daily operations (inadequate documentation or uneven task distribution).
- Highlighting incremental improvement opportunities (adopting new technology stacks or cross-functional training).
- Anticipating external risks (shifting project requirements or resource constraints).

As noted in resources such as *ThinkLouder* and *Team O’clock*, integrating SWOT analysis into Scrum rituals—such as sprint retrospectives, planning, and reviews—enhances transparency, fosters inspection, and drives adaptation. This practice empowers self-organizing teams, such as MakeItSimple, to align their processes with strategic objectives, ensuring consistent progress and responsiveness to challenges.

### 2.3 Agile Tools and SWOT Integration

The integration of SWOT analysis within modern agile workflows amplifies its effectiveness, transforming it from a static assessment into a dynamic, actionable framework. Instead of relying on specialized platforms, our team leveraged flexible digital tools already embedded in our workflow to conduct collaborative brainstorming, track tasks, and monitor progress—ensuring that SWOT outcomes translated directly into implementation

Our Approach to Applying SWOT in Agile Contexts:

| **Practice**                | **Application in SWOT**                                      |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Shared online documents**           | Real-time collaborative input for SWOT brainstorming  |
| **Video conferencing with screen share**        | Enabled team discussion and clarification during SWOT reviews         |
| **Spreadsheets and task boards**          | Assigned SWOT-derived action items and tracked ownership and progress     |
| **Retrospective sessions** | Incorporated SWOT discussions into sprint reviews for continuous learning        |

Benefits of Our Approach:

- Action items from SWOT were clearly documented with responsible owners and due dates.
- Outcomes were reviewed and refined across sprints, allowing for historical comparison and improvement tracking.
- Collective participation in SWOT analysis fostered a sense of ownership and accountability among team members.

By embedding SWOT analysis into our sprint rhythm, we ensured that strategic reflection was not a one-time event but an ongoing component of our team’s continuous improvement mindset.
